## Summary of Work Completed

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary Achievements
1. **Kalman Filtering Implementation**
   - Added dwpose_kalman_filter.py with per-joint 2D tracking
   - Supports 130 joints (18 body + 21Ã—2 hands + 70 face)
   - Configurable process/measurement noise parameters

2. **Advanced Batch Processing** 
   - Robust handling of large sequences (75-121 frames tested)
   - Progress reporting and memory optimization
   - Per-frame error handling with fallbacks

3. **Custom Threshold Parameters**
   - Detection threshold (0.05-0.9) for keypoint filtering
   - NMS threshold (0.1-0.9) for duplicate reduction
   - Custom filtering pipeline with backward compatibility

4. **Error Resolution**
   - Fixed tensor stacking issues with different image dimensions
   - Added comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
   - Resolved Kalman filtering display issues

### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements
- Added filterpy dependency for Kalman filtering
- Enhanced pose regeneration supporting hands/face
- Tensor dimension consistency fixes
- Memory management for large batches

### ðŸ“š Documentation
- Comprehensive CLAUDE.md update with examples
- Parameter tuning guidelines and troubleshooting
- Performance considerations and usage patterns

### ðŸš€ Final Status
- All major features working correctly
- Batch processing stable up to 121+ frames
- Kalman filtering smoothing body, hands, and face
- Code committed and pushed to GitHub
